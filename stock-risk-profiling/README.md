# 📊 Stock Risk Profiling with PCA and Clustering
*Using data science to reveal hidden patterns in stock risk and performance.*

This project applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **clustering algorithms** (K-Means and Agglomerative) to group stocks by their **risk–return profiles**.
It aims to uncover **defensive**, **balanced**, and **aggressive** categories using daily market data.

Built with Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `yfinance`). The analysis runs entirely in a single Jupyter notebook that renders cleanly on GitHub.

## ⚙️ Setup
